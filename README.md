## Introduction

Limitless Wheels is an innovative XR experience designed for individuals in wheelchairs who can move their upper bodies. The goal of this experience is to provide a sense of freedom and rehabilitation by allowing users to practice daily tasks in a safe and controlled environment. Many individuals in wheelchairs need to relearn independent living, and Limitless Wheels offers a way to engage in these activities in an immersive virtual space.

## Design Process

[_Add evidence on the general overview of how you planned, designed, and developed your project, including the goals, challenges, and solutions._]

For example:
x- Brainstorming: A screenshot of the whiteboard or post-it notes used to land the project's idea.
x- User Research: Pictures and summary of how you conducted user research, such as surveys, interviews, or observations, and what insights you gained from it.
- User Persona: A description of your target user, their needs, motivations, and pain points, and how your project addresses them.
- User Journey: A visualization of how your user interacts with your project, from the initial trigger to the final outcome, and what emotions they experience along the way.
- Wireframes and Prototypes: A collection of sketches, mockups, or prototypes that show the layout, structure, and functionality of your project, and how you tested and iterated on them.

Many wheelchair users face challenges when adapting to everyday life. They need to practice mobility and interaction within their living spaces while maintaining independence. The lack of engaging, hands-free virtual rehabilitation tools motivated the development of this experience.

### Target Users
- Individuals who use wheelchairs but retain upper-body mobility.
- People undergoing rehabilitation to regain independence in daily activities.
- Users seeking a virtual environment for safe mobility training.

#### Needs
- A controlled environment to practice daily tasks.
- An intuitive and immersive experience without requiring controllers.
- A system that encourages independence and boosts confidence.

#### Motivations:
- The desire to regain control over daily life activities.
- A fun, engaging way to practice mobility and hand coordination.
- Increased accessibility in virtual rehabilitation experiences.

#### Pain Points
- Traditional rehabilitation exercises can be repetitive and uninspiring.
- Many VR applications require hand controllers, limiting accessibility.
- A lack of real-life scenario training in standard rehabilitation programs.


## System description

### Features
- Virtual Apartment: A realistic, interactive space where users perform everyday tasks.
- Eye-Tracking Navigation: Users move by looking at directional arrows, freeing their hands for interactions.
- Hands-Free Object Interaction: A touch and grabbable system in Unity allows natural object manipulation.
- Task Completion System: Tasks like setting the table and organizing objects reinforce rehabilitation and independence.
- End-of-Experience Event: A rewarding conclusion signaled by a doorbell, reinforcing accomplishment.

#### Navigation System
The movement system is designed to be completely hands-free using an eye-tracking interface. Users look at directional arrows to move along the horizontal axis. This system provides:
- Intuitive Movement without requiring controllers.
- Focus on Tasks rather than on navigation mechanics.
- Increased Accessibility for individuals with limited hand function.

#### Object Interaction System
Using a Touch & Grabbable System in Unity, users can:
- Pick up and move objects naturally.
- Interact with items in a realistic manner.
- Precisely place objects where needed.
